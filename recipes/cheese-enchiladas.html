       <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Texas constant, these tex mex style cheese enchiladas use a chili gravy made from a unique blend of spices to give a warm kick. These are best served with refried beans and mexican rice alongside a salt-rimmed margarita. </p>
       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup lard or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, chicken broth, or water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>Pickled jalapeños, for serving</li>
      </ul> 
        

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>To make the gravy, heat the lard or oil in a pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the flour and stir until it's lightly browned and fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper until well combined. </li>
        <li>Pour in the broth, then whisk with the flour until well blended. </li>
        <li>Continue to whisk until the sauce thickens, about 3-5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to low and let the gravy simmer for 15 minutes. Add more broth or water to thin the sauce if it's too thick.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to make the enchiladas, preheat the oven to 450° F. Pour the vegetable oil into a baking dish or large cast-iron skillet.</li> 
        <li>Place the tortillas in the baking dish (it’s okay if they overlap) and make sure they are covered with the oil.</li> 
        <li>Place uncovered in the oven as it heats for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the tortillas are soft and warm. Remove the tortillas from the baking dish and cover.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 cup of chili gravy into the dish.</li>
        <li>To assemble the enchiladas, take a tortilla and place 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese and 1 tablespoon of the onion down the center then roll it. Place the rolled tortilla in the baking dish, seam side down. Continue with the remaining tortillas.</li>
        <li>After assembling the enchiladas, evenly pour over them the rest of the chili gravy. Sprinkle on top the remaining cheese and onions. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with pickled jalapeños on the side.</li></p>
